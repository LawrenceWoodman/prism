**Ruby microformat parser**

## Warning

This is so little right now. It's not even close to being done. Don't touch it until it has at least a minor version number (Right now it is v0.0.1). You've been warned.

It should be:

+ A fully featured microformat parser, with support for every microformat
+ A CLI for fetching microformats from a url or a string of html
+ Extensions so you can do something like: `String.is_a_valid? :hcard` in your tests
+ Export microformats to other standards. hCard => vCard.
+ HTML outlininer (using HTML5 sectioning)

Maybe some more than just that. It should be your lowercase-semantic-web friend.
